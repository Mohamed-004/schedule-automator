# Premium Features Implementation Guide

This document outlines the premium enterprise features added to the worker scheduling application and provides step-by-step instructions for verifying their correct implementation.

## 1. Smart Assign (AI-Powered Worker Recommendations)

Intelligent worker assignment that goes beyond simple availability by considering skills, client history, workload balancing, and more.

### Database Components
- `worker_skills` table - Tracks skills and proficiency levels for workers
- `worker_ratings` table - Stores client feedback on worker performance
- `job_types` table - Categorizes jobs and defines required skills
- `worker_locations` table - Optional geographic data for travel optimization

### Functions
- `get_recommended_workers` - SQL function that calculates a comprehensive recommendation score

### How to Verify
1. Run the SQL schema migration:
   ```sql
   -- Execute the worker skills schema
   \i worker_skills_schema.sql
   
   -- Execute the worker recommendation function
   \i worker_recommendation.sql
   ```

2. Add sample data:
   ```sql
   -- Add skills to a worker
   INSERT INTO worker_skills (worker_id, skill, level) 
   VALUES 
     ('worker-uuid', 'lawn maintenance', 4),
     ('worker-uuid', 'garden care', 3);
     
   -- Add a job type
   INSERT INTO job_types (name, description, required_skills) 
   VALUES ('Landscaping', 'General landscaping services', 
          ARRAY['lawn maintenance', 'garden care', 'pruning']);
          
   -- Add a worker rating
   INSERT INTO worker_ratings (job_id, worker_id, client_id, rating, comments)
   VALUES ('job-uuid', 'worker-uuid', 'client-uuid', 5, 'Excellent work!');
   ```

3. Test the recommendation function directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_recommended_workers(
     'business-uuid', 
     '2023-06-18 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMPTZ, 
     '2023-06-18 12:00:00'::TIMESTAMPTZ,
     'client-uuid',
     'job-type-uuid'
   );
   ```

4. Verify the UI displays recommendation scores and badges:
   - Navigate to the "Assign Jobs" page
   - Select a client, date, start/end time
   - Verify workers are sorted by recommendation score
   - Verify skill match and client preference badges are shown
   - Verify top recommended worker has the "Recommended" badge

## 2. Schedule Optimizer (Automated Time Slot Suggestions)

Instead of manually hunting for available slots, the system suggests optimal times based on worker schedules, minimizing downtime and travel.

### Functions
- `find_optimal_slots` - SQL function that analyzes available time slots and ranks them

### How to Verify
1. Run the SQL function setup:
   ```sql
   \i schedule_optimizer.sql
   ```

2. Test the function directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM find_optimal_slots(
     'business-uuid',
     '2023-06-18'::DATE,
     120, -- 2 hour job
     'client-uuid',
     'job-type-uuid',
     null, -- no preferred worker
     '08:00:00'::TIME,
     '18:00:00'::TIME
   );
   ```

3. Check if the function returns:
   - A list of time slots with scores
   - Worker recommendations for each slot
   - Clear explanations for why each slot is optimal

## 3. Proactive "Smart Alerts"

The system actively monitors schedules and notifies managers of potential issues before they become problems.

### Database Components
- `notifications` table - Stores alerts with severity levels and actionable links

### Functions
- `detect_overtime_risks` - Identifies workers approaching their weekly hour limits
- `detect_unassigned_jobs` - Finds jobs starting soon with no assigned worker
- `detect_scheduling_conflicts` - Detects double-bookings and conflicts

### How to Verify
1. Run the SQL setup:
   ```sql
   \i smart_alerts.sql
   ```

2. Run the alert detection functions manually:
   ```sql
   SELECT detect_overtime_risks();
   SELECT detect_unassigned_jobs();
   SELECT detect_scheduling_conflicts();
   ```

3. Check if alerts were generated:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

4. For production deployment:
   - Ensure pg_cron extension is enabled 
   - Uncomment the cron scheduling statements in `smart_alerts.sql`
   - Set up a notifications UI component in the dashboard

## Implementation Timeline
